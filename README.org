* macbl
Utility to adjust the brightness of the screen or keyboard of a macbook running Linux. Tested on a MacBook Air Mid 2013 13" running Arch Linux.

** Usage
#+BEGIN_SRC shell
  $ sudo ruby macbl.rb [screen|keyboard] [+,-]<number>
#+END_SRC

** Demo
#+BEGIN_SRC shell
  $ sudo ruby macbl.rb screen +500
  adjusting brightness from 677 to 1177 [max:2777]

  $ sudo ruby macbl.rb screen -100
  adjusting brightness from 1177 to 1077 [max:2777]

  $ sudo ruby macbl.rb keyboard +100
  adjusting brightness from 0 to 100 [max:255]
#+END_SRC

Personally I like to use this as a command to be executed when the brightness keys are pressed. In my 
Fluxbox setup I have something like this:
#+BEGIN_SRC
  # ~/.fluxbox/keys
  XF86MonBrightnessDown :Exec /home/rcosme/macbl.rb screen -100
  XF86MonBrightnessUp :Exec /home/rcosme/macbl.rb screen +100

  XF86KbdBrightnessDown :Exec /home/rcosme/macbl/macbl.rb keyboard -10
  XF86KbdBrightnessUp :Exec /home/rcosme/macbl/macbl.rb keyboard +10
#+END_SRC
